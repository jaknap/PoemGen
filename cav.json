But I remember him as better looking.\nHe was sensitive almost to the point of illness,\nand this highlighted his expression.\nHe appears to me better looking\nnow that my soul brings him back, out of Time.\n\nOut of Time. All these things are from very long ago\nthe sketch, the ship, the afternoon.\n\n"

    "poem": "Our efforts are those of men prone to disaster;\nour efforts are like those of the Trojans.\nWe just begin to get somewhere,\ngain a little confidence,\ngrow almost bold and hopeful,\n\nwhen something always comes up to stop us:\nAchilles leaps out of the trench in front of us\nand terrifies us with his violent shouting.\n\n\nOur efforts are like those of the Trojans.\nWe think well change our luck\nby being resolute and daring,\nso we move outside ready to fight.\n\nBut when the great crisis comes,\nour boldness and resolution vanish;\nour spirit falters, paralyzed,\nand we scurry around the walls\ntrying to save ourselves by running away.\n\nYet were sure to fail. Up there,\nhigh on the walls, the dirge has already begun.\nTheyre mourning the memory, the aura of our days.\nPriam and Hecuba mourn for us bitterly.\n\n"

Notice this Rhea:\nreverential, all fortitude, very old.\nNotice Pompey. And Marius here,\nand Paulus Aemilius, and Scipio Africanus.\nThe likeness as close as I could make it.\nAnd Patroklos (I still have to touch him up a bit).\nNear those pieces of yellowish marble there\nstands Kaisarion.\n\nAnd for some time now Ive been busy\nworking on a Poseidon. Im studying\nhis horses in particular: how to shape them exactly.\nThey have to be made so light\nthat its clear their bodies, their legs,\nare not touching the earth but galloping over water.\n\nBut heres my favorite work,\nwrought with the utmost care and feeling.\nThis oneit was a summer day, very hot,\nand my mind rose to ideal things\nthis one came to me in a vision, this young Hermes.\n\n"
